        <h2>About Natto</h2>
          <p>Have you fallen in love with the surprising taste and texture of natto, and would like to learn how to make it yourself? Here’s how to prepare this gooey, delicious food at home.
            Nattō is a traditional Japanese dish created from soybeans fermented using a bacteria called <em>Bacillus subtilis var. natto</em>.

            It is usually eaten with plain rice. It is very rich in protein and nutrients (rich in vitamin K2), which makes it also good for its health benefits.
            
            Its unique, strong and persistent flavour and sticky appearance can make it quite repulsive for those unaccustomed to it. But, for the same reasons, it has many fans!</p>
          <p>Making natto is relatively easy, but there are a few points to note in terms of temperature and equipment cleanliness.

            Utensils that come into contact with the starter and soybeans must be sterile. Before using, you can boil the utensils for 5 minutes or wash them in the dishwasher at high temperatures.
            
            Natto fermentation temperatures range between 38 and 45°C (100 and 113°F). You can use a low temperature set oven, a large dehydrator, or a yogurt maker. Also, be aware that it will smell strong, so choose your incubation room carefully.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>0.1g Natto Bacillus bacteria starter</li>
              <li>380g dry soy beans</li>
            </ul>
          <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Soak the soy beans overnight– they should expand and look plump. </li>
                <li>Discard the water and then cook the soy beans in an instant pot, pressure cooker or over the stove until tender. </li>
                <li>Lay cling wrap on a tray or shallow tupperware (this step is not essential but helps immensely with the clean up process). Sterilize any utensils and bowl with hot water to remove any bacteria. Drain the soybeans well and then add the soy beans to the tupperware.</li>
                <li>Add 1 tablespoon of filtered water into the pack of natto and mix to loosen. Then spread the natto over the soy beans and mix well. Sprinkle the starter over and mix. Cover with paper towel, cling wrap and then elastic bands to secure.</li>
                <li>Place in a yogurt maker, fermentation box or a warm area at 40 C for 24 hours. The next day, place into the fridge and continue to ferment for another 24 hours.</li>
                <li>The natto is complete! Store in the fridge for up to 2 days or transfer to portioned size freezer safe reusable bags or tupperware. When ready to eat, thaw in the fridge and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
